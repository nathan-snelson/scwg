    "details": "The second game of the SCWG league, sponsored by Outpost, will start at 7pm! Can I ask that players get to club no later than 6:45pm so we can guarantee a timely start, and please let me know if you will be late or won't be attending, thank you! This month will be a 2k event and will be slightly more flexible than previous months. Rather than all the games be played in one night you can arrange games for any Friday within the month and they can count towards your league points total! However you can only count one game as your league game (so you'll have to let me know before hand so I can tell you the mission you'll all be playing, not putting in the post as not everyone reads it so it wouldn't be fair!), probably polite to let your opponent know you'll be playing a league game so they can bring some filth too! I'll still be running a league night on the date in the post if people want to wait until that date to play but changing the format slightly for those who can't always guarantee being available."
